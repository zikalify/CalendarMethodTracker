# Calendar Method Tracker

A simple, privacy-focused Progressive Web App (PWA) to track menstrual cycles using the calendar method. All your data stays on your device—nothing is sent to servers.

## About the App

Calendar Method Tracker is designed to help you track your menstrual cycle and understand your fertility patterns using the calendar method of contraception. The app:

- **Logs period start dates** - Easily record when each period begins
- **Calculates cycle statistics** - Automatically computes your average cycle length and identifies patterns
- **Works fully offline** - Once installed, the app works completely without internet
- **Tolerates poor connections** - On slow networks (like weak 4G), it automatically falls back to cached data instead of failing
- **Privacy-first** - All data is stored locally on your device using browser storage; nothing is ever synced to external servers
- **Installable** - Add it to your home screen on any device (iOS, Android, or desktop)
- **Pause tracking** - Mark periods as paused if needed (e.g., during medical treatments)
